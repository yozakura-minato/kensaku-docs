##### **1. The Story**

Problem:

     Every Lunar New Year, my aunt needs to check Sao Hạn information for each family member—data that changes yearly.

Solutions:

* As a low-tech user, she must **ask** others who know this information.
* To help her, I first **searched the internet**, but they are post so it is difficult to query.
* I then collected the data in a **Google Spreadsheet file** to make searching easier, but it required too much manual effort and was still not user-friendly.
* This led me to build **KenSaku**—a better solution for me to help my aunt.



##### **2. Key Decisions**

* Web app instead of asking people

      → Always available, saves time and effort

* Web app instead of internet searching

      → Fast search

* Web app instead of Google Spreadsheet

     → Lower maintenance effort and better user experience



##### **3. Core Features**

* Search pages customization
* Datasets import and management
* Search result view
